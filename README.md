Project Overview:
This program demonstrates binary file input/output (I/O) in C++. It writes an integer value to a binary file and then reads it back. The program uses ofstream and ifstream to perform binary write and read operations, respectively. The integer is written to the file as raw binary data, which is then retrieved and displayed.

Key Features:
Binary File Writing: Writes an integer to a file in binary format using ofstream with the ios::binary flag.

Binary File Reading: Reads the binary data back into the integer using ifstream with the ios::binary flag.

Reinterpretation: Uses reinterpret_cast<char*> to treat the integer as a sequence of bytes for proper reading and writing in binary format.

Skills Demonstrated:
Binary File Operations: Understanding how to work with files in binary mode.

Data Reinterpretation: Using reinterpret_cast to convert between different data types and byte sequences for file I/O.

File Management: Demonstrating the proper opening and closing of files using ofstream and ifstream.

Files Included:
main.cpp â€“ Contains the main logic for writing an integer to a binary file and reading it back.
